# spotify_auth_proxy

This is an instance of a 'Spotify auth server' which acts as an interface between a client and the Spotify oauth API.

## Installation

With `go` installed, run

```sh
go get -u github.com/conradludgate/terraform-provider-spotify/spotify_auth_proxy
```

## Usage

First, you need a Spotify client ID and secret. Visit https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/ to create an application.

If you plan to run this proxy locally, set the redirect URI of the application to `http://localhost:27228/spotify_callback`.
If you're running it remotely, substitute an appropiate base url (eg `https://spotify.example.com/spotify_callback`)

You will also need to register the callback URI with Spotify for your application. Visit https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/, click on your application, find and click the "Edit Settings" button, and paste the `spotify_callback` URI above into "Redirect URIs". Scroll down and click "Save".

To start the server, make sure the environment variables `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` are set from the values on the Spotify dashboard.
If running remotely, also configure your base url

```sh
export SPOTIFY_PROXY_BASE_URI=https://spotify.example.com
```

Finally, run

```sh
spotify_auth_proxy
```

It should output the following:

```
APIKey:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Auth URL: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
```

Take note of these values.

Now, open a browser and navigate to the Auth URL. It should redirect you to Spotify to log in. After you log in, the auth server will redirect you back to the page where it should confirm that you've authorized correctly.

The API Key is how you will retrieve the access token. The server will handle the token expiration and refreshes for you.

The API Key is random on each invocation, you can specify the `SPOTIFY_PROXY_API_KEY` environment variable to keep it consistent

## Docker

Alternatively, you can use the Docker to run the Spotify auth proxy.

First, create a file named `.env` and populate it with your `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` values. Your file should look similar to the following.

```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Then, run the following command to start the auth proxy.

```
$ docker run --rm -it -p 27228:27228 --env-file ./.env ghcr.io/conradludgate/spotify-auth-proxy
APIKey: OK7b1j...
Token:  aoIvJT...
Auth:   http://localhost:27228/authorize?token=aoIvJT...
```
